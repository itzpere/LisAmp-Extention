# LisAmp-Extention
Browser extention for LisAmp that will act as a panel for playing music if you are in the channel and have music playing in your browser

## Try it
until i make a release for each browser you can try it like this:

### Firefox
Clone the repo and go to firefox folder, in terminal run `web-ext run` and it will open a new browser with extention running
else you can zip everything that is inside the folder (not the folder it self) and add it to Temporary extentions.

### Chrome
